# Hello World examples

These programs are a staged introduction to webgl. They are several levels of hello world-like material.

1. A single untransformed triangle with constant color.

2. As above with colored vertices.

3. As above with modelview and projection matrices added.

4. As above with animation added.

5. Same as above with html5 canvas-based text composited over the top.

## Note: These are written BADLY* to WebGL 1

*These represent hacks not best practices*
