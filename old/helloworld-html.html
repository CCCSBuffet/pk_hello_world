		HTML documents are split into two parts, a header and a body. The document itself is formatted
		in a fairly uniform fashion of opening and closing tags. See immediately, below where a header
		tag is introduced, it has some content and then is closed.

		There are some few exceptions such as the paragraph tag <p> seen below.
